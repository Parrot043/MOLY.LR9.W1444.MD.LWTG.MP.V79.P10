 * 1. Add QBM_TYPE_NET_UL_SHRD, which is mapped to FLC NET_UL_SHARED pool
 * 2. Allow QBM_TYPE_NET_UL_SHRD in RAL

 * 1. QBM change data length of HIF_UL_TYPE_S from 64 to 128 for hooking this gpd type on CCMNI2. (wrapped by __CCCICCMNI_SUPPORT__)
 * 	2. Map QBM_FLC_UL_POOL_ID_HIF_UL_02 to new FLC pool FLC2_POOL_ID_HIF_UL_02, which makes HIF_UL_TYPE and HIF_UL_TYPE_02 not sharing FLC pool.
 * 	3. Do not toggle EMPTY TCP ACK in TFT_PF (wrapped by __CCCICCMNI_SUPPORT__)
 * 	4. UPCM check priority by GPD type, instead of EMPTY TCP ACK bit toggled by TFT_PF (wrapped by __CCCICCMNI_SUPPORT__)
 * 	5. Do not config queue for HIF_UL_TYPE_01
 *
 * removed!
 * removed!
 * Add a new QBM type: QBM_TYPE_HIF_UL_TYPE_S for UL TCP ACK for better buffer usage efficiency.
 *
 * removed!
 * removed!
 * prepare HIF_UL_TYPE, HIF_UL_TYPE_01, HIF_UL_TYPE_02.

 * separate flc related function from  qmu_bm.h to qmu_bm_flc.h
