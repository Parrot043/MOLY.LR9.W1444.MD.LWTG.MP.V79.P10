/* BitStream
 *
 *      A bit stream allows bit fields to be read and written to,
 *      just like an byte stream allows byte to be read and written
 *      to. Reading and writing of bit fields is done to an underlying
 *      byte stream, in network byte order.
 *
 *      bit_stream_init sets the underlying byte stream and the
 *      current read/write position within the byte stream. Can also
 *      be called when a seek to a new position is desired.

 *      The values which are read by bit_stream_read are returned as
 *      native unsigned integers.
 *
 *      Similarly the values which are passed to bit_stream_write for
 *      writing should be passed as native unsigned integers.
 *
 *      Both bit_stream_read and bit_stream_write, increment the
 *      current position,to facilitate sequential operation.
 *      bit_stream_cur_pos returns the number of bytes, the underlying
 *      byte pointer has been moved since bit_stream_init.
