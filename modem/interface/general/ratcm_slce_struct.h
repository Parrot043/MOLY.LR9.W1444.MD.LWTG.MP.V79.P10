/* Description: These operations allow the transfer of control
   messages for radio access bearer establishment between non-access
   strata elements on each side of the access interface. The
   operations allow the IF side to initialise a radio access
   bearer. The operation also implies a request to the AS to allocate
   transmission resources to the radio access bearer.

   A radio access bearer identification uniquely identifies the radio
   access bearer. It is used in all primitives that pertain to the
   radio access bearer. It also serves as the binding to a NAS call.

   The Iu bearer identification identifies the Iu connection.  A
   quality of service request specifies the bearer characteristics
   that apply to the radio access bearer (ref: [23.110;6.2.2.3.4]).
