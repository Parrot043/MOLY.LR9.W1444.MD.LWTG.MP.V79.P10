   DESCRIPTION: Frequently used Nucleus PLUS code is inlined (using macros) when this

                inlining (using macros) - actual function declarations are called in
                this case.

                stack checking code.
   NOTE:        If NU_STACK_FILL is enabled below (NU_TRUE), an additional check for
                stack overflow will occur in the scheduler using the stack fill pattern.

                are not compiled as part of the Nucleus PLUS library.

/* DEFINE:      NU_MIN_RAM_ENABLED

   DESCRIPTION: This define is used to minimize the use of RAM by Nucleus PLUS.  The
                trade-off for minimizing RAM usage is a decrease in speed / performance.
                Setting this define to NU_TRUE will reduce RAM usage.

/* DEFINE:      NU_NMI_SUPPORT_ENABLED
   DEFAULT:     NU_TRUE
   DESCRIPTION: This define is used to enable / disable the Nucleus Middleware
                Initialization support.  The default setting of NU_TRUE enables
                NMI support.  Setting this to NU_FALSE will disable this support.
   NOTE:        The Nucleus PLUS library and application must be rebuilt after changing
                this define.
   NOTE:        This setting can be changed to NU_FALSE if not using Nucleus Middleware
                or an application does not want to utilize the automatic initialization
                for the Nucleus Middleware.  The result will be a smaller footprint
                for Nucleus PLUS. */

/* DEFINE:      NU_ZC_INITIALIZATION

   DESCRIPTION: This define is used to determine if the Zero Copy component is to be
                initialized when Nucleus PLUS starts up or not.  When this define is
                set to NU_TRUE the Zero Copy component is initialized.  When this
                define is set to NU_FALSE the Zero Copy component is not automatically
                initialized at startup.

                changing this define.            */

   DESCRIPTION: This define is used by Nucleus PLUS to initialize the Zero Copy
                component when NU_ZC_INITIALIZATION is set to NU_TRUE (above).
   NOTE:        The number of Zero Copy objects necessary for an application is totally
                dependent on the application's use of the Zero Copy software.
   NOTE:        The Nucleus PLUS library and application must be rebuilt after
                changing this define.            */

/* DEFINE:      NU_ZC_<SERVICE>_INCLUDED
   DEFAULT:     NU_TRUE
   DESCRIPTION: These defines are used to configure which zero copy services are
                available to applications.  The default settings (NU_TRUE) will include
                all zero copy services within the Nucleus PLUS library.  Changing any
                setting to NU_FALSE will cause this zero copy service to be excluded
                from the library.
   NOTE:        Certain zero copy services cannot be disabled.  These include:
                initialization, creating a buffer, deleting a buffer, inserting data in
                a buffer, and getting the optimal segment / offset address.
   NOTE:        The benefit of setting unused services to be excluded will be a savings
                in code space in the final application's executable image.
   NOTE:        The Nucleus PLUS library and application must be rebuilt after
                changing this define.            */
